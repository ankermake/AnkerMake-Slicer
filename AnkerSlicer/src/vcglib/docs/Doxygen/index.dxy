/** \mainpage The VCG Library
The Visualization and Computer Graphics Library (VCG for short) is
a open source portable C++ templated library for manipulation, processing
and displaying with OpenGL of triangle and tetrahedral meshes.

VCG Lib uses a git repository hosted by github at http://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/vcglib/

The library, composed by more than 100k lines of code,
is released under the GPL license, and it is the base of most of the
software tools of the <b>Visual Computing Lab</b> of the Italian National Research Council Institute ISTI
(http://vcg.isti.cnr.it), like metro and MeshLab.


The VCG library is tailored to mostly manage triangular meshes:
The library is fairly large and offers many state of the art functionalities for processing meshes, like:
- high quality quadric-error edge-collapse based simplification,
- efficient spatial query structures (uniform grids, hashed grids, kdtree, ...) ,
- advanced smoothing and fairing algorithms,
- computation of curvature,
- optimization of texture coordinates,
- Hausdorff distance computation,
- Geodesic paths,
- mesh repairing capabilities,
- isosurface extraction and advancing front meshing algorithms,
- Poisson Disk sampling and other tools to sample point distributions over meshes,
- subdivision surfaces,

Notable Applications
-------
A number of applications have been developed using the vcglib:
- <a href="http://www.meshlab.net">MeshLab</a>: the renowned open source mesh processing is based on this library.
- \subpage metro "Metro, the tool for measuring differences between meshes"
- The first high quality  <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=940008"> out-of-core mesh simplifier </a> that was used by the Stanford Digital Michelangelo project to process their huge 3D scanned models.
