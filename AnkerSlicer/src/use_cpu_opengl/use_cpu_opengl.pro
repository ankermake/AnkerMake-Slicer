# This project is supposed to be compiled only with windows.
# It creates a binary file inside the MESHLAB_DISTRIB folder that is called
# UseCPUOpenGL. This binary file is automatically run by meshlab
# only if glewInit() fails (therefore, drivers do not support newer OpenGL
# versions). When UseCPUOpenGL is run, a file called "opengl32.dll" will be
# renamed/placed in the meshlab folder, overriding the system one and making meshlab
# able to start using a CPU implementation of OpenGL.
