## AnkerMake Slicer

 The AnkerMake Slicer is a toolpath generator for AnkerMake 3D printers: it reads 3D models (STL, OBJ, AMF, 3MF) and converts them into G-code instructions.  The AnkerMake Slicer sends the produced G-code file to the 3D printer and can initiate the print.

â€‹        The AnkerMake Slicer engine is based on version 4.11 of the CuraEngine open-source slicer project. The main program is based on the MeshLab open-source project. We have adopted the plug-in management mechanism to abstract and segment the 3D main interface with the slicer parameter module and the slicer engine process, ensuring low coupling in the framework.

**Main features of the AnkerMake Slicer**

- Basic slicing features and G-Code viewer;

- Remote control and monitoring;

- Hybrid/tree/normal support types, customized support;
- Multi-platform (Win/Mac) support;
- Intelligent and easy exporting slicing parameters;
- G-code path simulation with speed, acceleration, and other parameters closer to the real operation of 3D printers;

**High-speed printing quality optimization**

- Overhang printing effect optimization;
- Small detail printing effect optimization;
- Outer wall single-layer printing quality optimization;
- Motion path optimization;
- Optimization of the hole wall printing effect;
- Micro feature merging and smoothing node jitter;

#### 2. Building the AnkerMake Slicer

- Download the codes to a local directory.

- Navigate to the location where you saved the codes, and then open /AnkerSlicer/src/AnkerSlicer.pro with Qt Creator.

- ### Compile the project.

## Mac Compile Guide

### 1 Environment Setup

- Install the following:
  - Xcode from App Store.
  - Qt Creator from https://www.qt.io/download
  - libomp   `brew install libomp`

- Building the AnkerMake Slicer

**There are two ways to build the AnkerMake Slicer.**

Use Qt Creator to build the AnkerMake Slicer

- Download the codes to a local directory.

- Navigate to the location where you saved the codes, and then open /AnkerSlicer/src/AnkerSlicer.pro with Qt Creator.

### 2 Configure the Qt Creator, kits, QT version, compilers, debuggers, and CMake.

### Change omp path in file `AnkerSlicer/src/general.pri`

```shell
 macx:{
        QMAKE_LFLAGS += -L/opt/homebrew/Cellar/libomp/14.0.6/lib/ -lomp #change the value to the right path of omp
        INCLUDEPATH += /opt/homebrew/Cellar/libomp/14.0.6/include/
    }
```

### Compile the project

Run this script to build the AnkerMake Slicer.

- Modify the path of SrcCode, libomp and Qt Creator.
- Save the shell to a file named buildAnkerMake.sh and modify the permissions with the command `chmod +x buildAnkerMake.sh`
- Run `./buildAnkerMake.sh`

``` shell
echo "mac installer build"
CURRENT_DIR=$(dirname "$0")
cd "$CURRENT_DIR"
echo "current dir: "$PWD
CURRENT_DIR=$PWD
tempDate=$(date +"%Y%m%d%s")
tempPath=build_$tempDate
mkdir $tempPath
cd $tempPath
cp -R /Users/anker/AnkerSlicer .  # if you download the src here
cd ./ankerslicer
#complier macos
ompPath="/opt/homebrew/Cellar/libomp/14.0.6" #please change the value to the right path
qmake_path=/Users/anker/Qt/5.15.10/clang_64/bin #please change the value to the right path
export PATH=$PATH:$qmake_path
mkdir build_mac&&cd build_mac
qmake DEFINES+=FORCE_ARM "QMAKE_LFLAGS+=-L$ompPath/lib/ -lomp" "INCLUDEPATH+=$ompPath/include/" ../src/AnkerSlicer.pro
make -j8
